# ATMExercise
Simple React ATM
<img src="./atm.png" />

## How To Run 
To run this app clone the files to your machine and then run npm start in the console within the same folder as the files you cloned. This will open the ATM. 

## Roadmap of future improvements
In the future I would like this to make this more refined and add some more styling so it's not so simplistic
